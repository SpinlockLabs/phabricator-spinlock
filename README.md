# Spinlock extension for Phabricator
Here lies the code for the Spinlock developed extension for Phabricator,
the amazing issue-tracker, code review, and everything else tool!

## Who?
This extension for Phabricator is supported and developed by Spinlock Labs.

## What?
As we use Phabricator for work and personal projects, we want Phabricator to
consume as much of our lives as it can. So we decided to build some useful
utilities into the already amazing Phabricator!

This extension is licensed under MIT, so feel free to fork it and make it
your own.

### Phackages (in development)
This application integrates with a shipping API to track packages.

### Phurchases (planning)
This application will track purchase orders and reimbursements.

## Why?
Phabricator is impressively extensible, and we want to make it even more
useful than it already is. If we could make it U.S. President, I think
it'd do a stellar job (as good as a machine could do).
